The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. Customer churn basically refers to the loss of customers, which is a critical issue for businesses. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them by solving the issue raised by them and the data used for this project is taken from Kaggle's Bank Customer Churn Datasets.This project aimed to predict customer churn using three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. After splitting the data into training and test sets, each model was trained and evaluated. The Random Forest Classifier showed the highest accuracy, and an example prediction was made using this model. By identifying customers likely to churn, the bank can develop targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn rates as the bank faces many problems when the customer left the bank without giving any informations regarding it.
